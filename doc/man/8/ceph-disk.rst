Description
===========

:program:`ceph-disk` is a utility that can prepare and activate a disk, partition or
directory as a Ceph OSD. It is run directly or triggered by :program:`ceph-deploy`
or ``udev``. It can also be triggered by other deployment utilities like ``Chef``,
``Juju``, ``Puppet`` etc.

It actually automates the multiple steps involved in manual creation and start
of an OSD into two steps of preparing and activating the OSD by using the
subcommands ``prepare`` and ``activate``.

Subcommands
============

prepare
--------

Prepare a directory, disk or drive for a Ceph OSD. It creates a GPT partition,
marks the partition with Ceph type ``uuid``, creates a file system, marks the
file system as ready for Ceph consumption, uses entire partition and adds a new
partition to the journal disk. It is run directly or triggered by
:program:`ceph-deploy`.

Usage::

	ceph-disk prepare --cluster [cluster-name] --cluster-uuid [uuid] --fs-type
	[ext4|xfs|btrfs] [data-path] [journal-path]

Other options like :option:`--osd-uuid`, :option:`--journal-uuid`,
:option:`--zap-disk`, :option:`--data-dir`, :option:`--data-dev`,
:option:`--journal-file`, :option:`--journal-dev`, :option:`--dmcrypt`
and :option:`--dmcrypt-key-dir` can also be used with the subcommand.

activate
--------

Activate the Ceph OSD. It mounts the volume in a temporary location, allocates
an OSD id (if needed), remounts in the correct location
``/var/lib/ceph/osd/$cluster-$id`` and starts ceph-osd. It is triggered by
``udev`` when it sees the OSD GPT partition type or on ceph service start with
``ceph disk activate-all``. It is also run directly or triggered by
:program:`ceph-deploy`.

Usage::

	ceph-disk activate [PATH]

Here, [PATH] is path to a block device or a directory.

An additional option :option:`--activate-key` has to be used with this
subcommand when a copy of ``/var/lib/ceph/bootstrap-osd/{cluster}.keyring``
isn't present in the OSD node.

Usage::

	ceph-disk activate [PATH] [--activate-key PATH]

Another option :option:`--mark-init` can also be used with this subcommand.
``--mark-init`` provides init system to manage the OSD directory.

activate-journal
----------------

Activate an OSD via it's journal device. ``udev`` triggers
``ceph-disk activate-journal <dev>`` based on the partition type.

Usage::

	ceph-disk activate-journal [DEV]

Here, [DEV] is the path to a journal block device.

Others options like :option:`--activate-key` and :option:`--mark-init` can also
be used with this subcommand.

``--mark-init`` provides init system to manage the OSD directory.

Usage::

	ceph-disk activate-journal [--activate-key PATH] [--mark-init INITSYSTEM] [DEV]

activate-all
------------

Activate all tagged OSD partitions. ``activate-all`` relies on
``/dev/disk/by-parttype-uuid/$typeuuid.$uuid`` to find all partitions. Special
``udev`` rules are installed to create these links. It is triggered on ceph
service start or run directly.

Usage::

	ceph-disk activate-all

Others options like :option:`--activate-key` and :option:`--mark-init` can
also be used with this subcommand.

``--mark-init`` provides init system to manage the OSD directory.

Usage::

	ceph-disk activate-all [--activate-key PATH] [--mark-init INITSYSTEM]

list
----

List disk partitions and Ceph OSDs. It is run directly or triggered by
:program:`ceph-deploy`.

Usage::

	ceph-disk list

suppress-activate
-----------------

Suppress activate on a device (prefix). Mark devices that you don't want to
activate with a file like ``/var/lib/ceph/tmp/suppress-activate.sdb`` where the
last bit is the sanitized device name (/dev/X without the /dev/ prefix). A
function ``is_suppressed()`` checks for and  matches a prefix (/dev/). It means
suppressing sdb will stop activate on sdb1, sdb2, etc.

Usage::

	ceph-disk suppress-activate [PATH]

Here, [PATH] is path to a block device or a directory.

unsuppress-activate
-------------------

Stop suppressing activate on a device (prefix). It is used to activate a device
that was earlier kept deactivated using ``suppress-activate``.

Usage::

	ceph-disk unsuppress-activate [PATH]

Here, [PATH] is path to a block device or a directory.

zap
---

Zap/erase/destroy a device's partition table and contents. It actually uses
``sgdisk`` and it's option ``--zap-all`` to destroy both GPT and MBR data
structures so that the disk becomes suitable for repartitioning. ``sgdisk``
then uses ``--mbrtogpt`` to convert the MBR or BSD disklabel disk to a GPT
disk. The ``prepare`` subcommand can now be executed which will create a new
GPT partition. It is also run directly or triggered by :program:`ceph-deploy`.

Usage::

	ceph-disk zap [DEV]

Here, [DEV] is path to a block device.

Options
=======

.. option:: --prepend-to-path PATH

   Prepend PATH to $PATH for backward compatibility (default ``/usr/bin``).

.. option:: --statedir PATH

   Directory in which ceph configuration is preserved (default ``/usr/lib/ceph``).

.. option:: --sysconfdir PATH

   Directory in which ceph configuration files are found (default ``/etc/ceph``).

.. option:: --cluster

   Provide name of the ceph cluster in which the OSD is being prepared.

.. option:: --cluster-uuid

   Provide uuid of the ceph cluster in which the OSD is being prepared.

.. option:: --fs-type

   Provide the filesytem type for the OSD. e.g. ``xfs/ext4/btrfs``.

.. option:: --osd-uuid

	Unique OSD uuid to assign to the disk.

.. option:: --journal-uuid

	Unique uuid to assign to the journal.

.. option:: --zap-disk

	Destroy the partition table and content of a disk.

.. option:: --data-dir

	Verify that ``[data-path]`` is of a directory.

.. option:: --data-dev

	Verify that ``[data-path]`` is of a block device.

.. option:: --journal-file

	Verify that journal is a file.

.. option:: --journal-dev

	Verify that journal is a block device.

.. option:: --dmcrypt

	Encrypt ``[data-path]`` and/or journal devices with ``dm-crypt``.

.. option:: --dmcrypt-key-dir

	Directory where ``dm-crypt`` keys are stored.

.. option:: --activate-key

   Use when a copy of ``/var/lib/ceph/bootstrap-osd/{cluster}.keyring`` isn't

.. option:: --mark-init

   Provide init system to manage the OSD directory.
